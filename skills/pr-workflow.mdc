# PR Workflow Skill

**This checklist MUST be followed for EVERY pull request. No exceptions.**

## Phase 1: Before Creating PR

Execute these validation steps before creating the PR:

### 1. Detect Project Type and Run Validations

```bash
# Determine project type and run appropriate checks
```

**For JavaScript/TypeScript projects:**
1. Run `pnpm typecheck` or `npm run typecheck` or `yarn typecheck`
2. Run `pnpm build` or `npm run build` or `yarn build`
3. Run `pnpm test` or `npm test` or `yarn test`

**For Python projects:**
1. Run `mypy .` or equivalent type checking
2. Run `python -m pytest` or equivalent test command
3. Run `ruff check .` or `flake8` for linting

**For Makefiles present:**
1. Check for `make typecheck`, `make build`, `make test` targets
2. Prefer make commands over direct package manager commands

### 2. Security Scan

Before committing, verify:
- [ ] No hardcoded paths (e.g., `/Users/username/...`)
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or tokens
- [ ] No machine-specific configuration values
- [ ] Environment variables used for sensitive data

### 3. Create the PR

Use the GitHub MCP tools to:
1. Search for `pull_request_template.md` in the repository
2. Use the template structure for the PR description
3. Create the PR with `mcp_github_create_pull_request`

---

## Phase 2: Autonomous PR Monitoring (REQUIRED)

**You MUST autonomously monitor and manage PRs through to merge.**

### 4. Monitor Bot Reviews

Poll the PR status every 30-60 seconds until all bot reviews complete:

```
Use BOTH of these methods to get complete check status:

1. mcp_github_pull_request_read with method "get_status" 
   → Returns commit statuses (Vercel, etc.)

2. mcp_github_pull_request_read with method "get" 
   → Check the "mergeable_state" field in the response
```

**Understanding Check Types:**
- **Commit Statuses** (`get_status`): Older API, used by Vercel, some CI systems
- **Check Runs**: Newer API used by GitHub Actions, Cursor Bugbot, Copilot, Sentry
- **IMPORTANT**: `get_status` does NOT show Check Runs! You must also check `mergeable_state`.

**Mergeable State Values:**
- `"clean"` → ✅ ALL checks passed, safe to merge
- `"unstable"` → ⚠️ Some checks are failing or pending - DO NOT MERGE
- `"blocked"` → ❌ Branch protection rules are blocking merge
- `"behind"` → ⚠️ Branch needs to be updated with base branch
- `"unknown"` → GitHub is still computing - poll again

**Polling Strategy:**
1. Call `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with `method: "get_status"` to see commit statuses
2. Call `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with `method: "get"` and check `mergeable_state`
3. If `mergeable_state` is NOT `"clean"`, wait 30-60 seconds and poll again
4. **DO NOT proceed to merge unless `mergeable_state` is `"clean"`**
5. Continue polling until `mergeable_state` becomes `"clean"` or a final failure state

### 5. Address ALL Bot Feedback

When bot reviews complete:

1. **Read every comment:**
   - Use `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with `method: "get_review_comments"`
   - Use `mcp_github_pull_request_read` with `method: "get_comments"`

2. **For each issue raised:**
   - Analyze the feedback
   - Implement the fix in the codebase
   - Commit and push the changes
   - Reply to the comment confirming the fix using `mcp_github_add_issue_comment`

3. **DO NOT ignore any feedback** - every bot comment must be addressed

### 6. Wait for Re-validation

After pushing fixes:
1. Poll status checks again (same as Step 4)
2. All checks must show `SUCCESS` (not `NEUTRAL` or `IN_PROGRESS`)
3. If any check produces new feedback, repeat Step 5

---

## Phase 3: Merge Criteria

**ALL conditions must be TRUE before merging:**

### 7. Final Verification Checklist

**MANDATORY PRE-MERGE CHECK:**
```
Call mcp_github_pull_request_read with method "get" and verify:
  - mergeable_state == "clean"  ← THIS IS THE GATE
  - merged == false (PR not already merged)
```

**If `mergeable_state` is NOT `"clean"`, DO NOT MERGE. Period.**

Additional requirements:
- [ ] `mergeable_state` is `"clean"` (not "unstable", "blocked", or "behind")
- [ ] Zero unaddressed bot comments on the latest commit
- [ ] All commit statuses show `SUCCESS` (from `get_status`)
- [ ] No failing CI jobs or Check Runs
- [ ] All review threads resolved

### 8. Execute Merge

**Only after `mergeable_state` is `"clean"`:**

```bash
# Merge the PR
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --merge

# Or use MCP tool:
# mcp_github_merge_pull_request with merge_method: "merge"
```

**NEVER merge when `mergeable_state` is `"unstable"` - this means checks are pending or failing.**

### 9. Verify Success

After merge:
1. Confirm the merge was successful
2. Report the final status to the user

---

## Error Handling

### If checks fail repeatedly:
1. After 3 failed attempts at the same issue, pause and ask for human guidance
2. Provide a summary of what was tried and what failed

### If bot feedback is unclear:
1. Ask clarifying questions before implementing a fix
2. Document the ambiguity in the PR comments

### If merge is blocked:
1. Check for branch protection rules
2. Check for required reviewers
3. Report the blocking condition to the user

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake: Merging when `mergeable_state` is "unstable"
**Problem:** `get_status` only shows commit statuses, not GitHub Check Runs. You see "1 check passed" but there are actually 3 checks, 2 of which are pending.
**Fix:** ALWAYS check `mergeable_state` from the PR details. Only merge when it's `"clean"`.

### ❌ Mistake: Not actually waiting between polls
**Problem:** Calling status checks once and proceeding immediately.
**Fix:** If checks are pending, actually wait 30-60 seconds before polling again. Use multiple polling iterations.

### ❌ Mistake: Treating `mergeable: true` as approval to merge
**Problem:** `mergeable` only means there are no git conflicts. It does NOT mean checks passed.
**Fix:** Check `mergeable_state`, not just `mergeable`. They are different fields with different meanings:
  - `mergeable: true` → No git conflicts
  - `mergeable_state: "clean"` → All checks passed, safe to merge

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr status

# View PR checks
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>

# View PR comments  
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --comments

# Merge PR
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --merge
```

**MCP Tools:**
- `mcp_github_create_pull_request` - Create PR
- `mcp_github_pull_request_read` - Get PR details, diff, status, comments
  - `method: "get"` → Returns `mergeable_state` (the true indicator of check status)
  - `method: "get_status"` → Returns commit statuses only (NOT Check Runs!)
  - `method: "get_review_comments"` → Returns code review comments
  - `method: "get_comments"` → Returns PR conversation comments
- `mcp_github_merge_pull_request` - Merge PR (only when `mergeable_state` is `"clean"`)
- `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` - Reply to comments
